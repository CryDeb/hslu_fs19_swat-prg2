-doku


bugs:
-resume when nothing saved throws exception (jerry: should check if file available and otherwise not navigating to other view / controller)
-resume game of differnt size than default
-when initializing a network game, the opponents view sometimes does not get loaded completely. This might be because the view gets updated by a different thread (eg network request handling). --> use SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait(..) to solve. But it may also just be a problem switching from the VM window to the Host.


bugs which should not happen as soon as view is implemented:
-playing a disk (me / opponent) while it is not my / opponents turn raises an exception currently


nice to have:
-create a settings view
-introduce interfaces for Navigator, NetworkRequestManager, NetworkPlayerSearcher
-check logs (correct class name, still required, meaningfull, correct level)
-more intelligent AIPlayer
-When an init game is received player does not get asked whether he actually wants to play, but game starts automatically
