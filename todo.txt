required:
-todos
-playing (me / opponent) when not my / opponents turn raises currently an exception
-ui
-doku


bugs:
-when initializing a game, the opponents view sometimes does not get loaded completely. This might be because the view gets updated by a different thread (eg network request handling). --> use SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait(..) to solve. But it may also just be a problem switching from the VM window to the Host.
-sometimes the opponent Turn does not get communinicated to the other network side's GameField.


nice to have:
-check log levels
-When an init game is received nothing happens yet (notify controller, change state?, actually ask player if he wants to play?)
-playing an invalid disk (outside column-range / column full / etc) not handled
