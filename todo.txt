required:
-todos
-playing a disk (me / opponent) while it is not my / opponents turn raises an exception currently
-ui
-doku


potential bugs:
-load when nothing saved


bugs:
-when initializing a game, the opponents view sometimes does not get loaded completely. This might be because the view gets updated by a different thread (eg network request handling). --> use SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait(..) to solve. But it may also just be a problem switching from the VM window to the Host.


nice to have:
-introduce interfaces
-check logs (correct class name, still required, meaningfull, correct level)
-more intelligent AIPlayer
-When an init game is received nothing happens yet (notify controller, change state?, actually ask player if he wants to play?)
-playing an invalid disk (outside column-range / column full / etc) not handled (will not be possible from ui side)
